# RTF utilities

## The relationship between RTF as a format and Word styling

Word software applies functions to alter the paragraph formatting of its documents, sometimes initiated by GUI buttons.

When Word opens an RTF file, it can recognise styles indicated by the data file, but any style information already within a paragraph block is not acted upon: it is mainly relevant to the style inspector.

When Word is asked by a user to apply a defined style, it will rewrite paragraph formatting to conform to the defined style.
